not easily solvable with standard data types...

but..
F_n = (phi^n - psi^n)/(phi-psi) = (phi^n - psi^n)/sqrt(5) 

all we have to do is solve for n st F_n >= 10^1000, and use wolfram alpha to get the fibonacci number. trivial! 

phi^n - psi^n > sqrt(5)*10^1000

Approximation: psi^n -> 0, since psi<1, and n is expected to be quite large.

therefore, phi^n > sqrt(5)*10^1000

n > log(sqrt(5)*10^1000)/log(phi)...

n > log(sqrt(5))/log(phi) + 1000/log(phi)

easy enough..
